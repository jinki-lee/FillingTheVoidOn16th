        About this Project.
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        I commute to my school, SAIT located on 16th ave, in the comfort of my own vehicle. Nearly at every red light or stop, I find myself in line with a homeless person walking in my direction asking car to car for quite literally anything they can offer. I’ve witnessed some kind souls giving spare change, or sometimes other non-currency items to those in need, but I am guilty of just rolling up the window and looking away in the distance.
      </p>          
      <p>
        I wish I could give spare change without hesitating, but I will never know what their story is or how they ended up in the position they are in. An article I read online explains why you shouldn’t give money directly to homeless people, because you will never know how that money will be used and if it will end up funding their addictions such as alcohol & substance abuse, gambling, etc. Instead, there are other ways to support these by giving non-currency items. There are online thread posts of people who have previously experienced being homeless and the Calgary Mustard Seed recommends that you give essential items, such as socks,  hygiene products, and gift cards to fast food restaurants or non-perishable food, rather than money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Easier said than done... 
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you always prepared to give these at your disposal? Do you carry around a brand-new pair of socks to give away? Because I surely don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why I started this project. It is a non-profit project I, myself, run completely at the cost of my own time, money, and generous donations from others. I live a comfortable life, having everything I need and want with the click of one button on Amazon, or not having to worry if there will be enough food on the table. I live a privileged life by going to the University of Calgary to finish my degree in business, and then enrolling at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology for software development.  I also live by the phrase “paying it forward”. Being set up for success and having a lot of stress taken off of me is a blessing, but costs me absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing my first semester at SAIT, one of my instructors quoted that we would be the next generation to fill in the void and change the world. The phrase stuck with me, as there is a void to be filled by the upcoming generation of software developers. A void to be filled by people with unique talents. A void to be filled by love. A void to be filled by good people. A void to be filled by you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates the education I have learned from my business and software development background.
